## About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a love for the Go programming language, experienced in DevOps practices, and a big fan of Neovim. I also enjoy creating custom keyboards and configuring them with software like QMK and ZMK. Bash scripting is another one of my hobbies, and I'm getting into 3D printing as well.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Lua and ZMK.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, DevOps, Neovim, custom keyboards, QMK, ZMK, 3D printing, or anything tech-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Make a pull request on any of my repos.
